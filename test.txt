#first: model.py
in this step we again build the model from the training data. Once done we save the model through pickle.

#second server.py
load the saved pickle file and then start with the streamlit part. Stream lit is used to render the front end

in the server file make all the input part.
then once all data is loaded move to changing the categories, like converty gender to binary.
then pass all the set data to model for prediction.
